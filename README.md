## Welcome!

This repository showcases my skills in full-stack software engineering, machine learning, and modern web development. PowerAI is a multi-component project designed to demonstrate:

- **Backend API development** with FastAPI and Python
- **Database design and migrations** using Alembic and SQL
- **Frontend engineering** with React and TypeScript
- **Machine learning integration** for intelligent features
- **DevOps and deployment** readiness

---

## Repository Structure

- **app_ai/**: Python-based AI and API logic (FastAPI, ML, embeddings)
- **backend/**: Database models, migrations, and service layer
- **frontend/**: React + TypeScript web application

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- Python (FastAPI, ML, data processing)
- SQL, Alembic (migrations)
- RESTful API design
- React, TypeScript, CSS
- Software architecture & modular design
- DevOps basics (Procfile, requirements management)
- Testing (unit, integration)

---

## How to Explore

- Review the code in each folder for best practices and modularity
- See `app_ai/main.py` for API endpoints and ML integration
- Check `frontend/src/` for React component structure and UI logic
- Database schema and migrations are in `backend/alembic/`
