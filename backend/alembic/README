# Lifting Analytics App Alembic Configuration

This folder contains Alembic migration scripts and configuration for the Postgres database used by the FastAPI backend.

- Alembic manages schema changes and migrations for your database.
- Migration scripts are in the `versions/` subfolder.
- The Alembic environment is configured in `env.py`.
- See `alembic.ini` in the project root for connection settings.

1. To create a new migration:
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Describe your change"
2. To apply migrations:
   alembic upgrade head
3. To downgrade:
   alembic downgrade -1
