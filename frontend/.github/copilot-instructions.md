This project is a Create React App in TypeScript for a Duolingo-like workout tracker UI. The app should:

- Allow users to input workouts in a natural format (e.g., "INCLINE CHEST PRESS\n140X20\n150X12...").
- Parse and structure the input, sending it to a FastAPI backend.
- Visualize progress, streaks, and stats in a gamified way (badges, streaks, charts).
- Connect to the backend for analytics, summaries, and normalization.
